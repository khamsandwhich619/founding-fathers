		<p> In honor of the four years I spent studying history in college, my first basic website will explore four weird facts <br> for each year I went to college about four major founding fathers of the United States of America.

		</p>
		<p> Here is a list of the founding fathers I will go over:</p>
			<ol>
				<a href="georgewash.html"><li> George Washington</li></a>
				<a href="thomasjeff.html"><li> Thomas Jefferson</li></a>
				<a href="jamesmad.html"><li> James Madison</li></a>
				<a href="alexanderhamil.html"><li> Alexander Hamilton</li></a>
			</ol>
<!-- Each founding father I go over will have 4 weird facts and an individual page with a photo -->
<!-- Im going to stay true to the course and refrain from using CSS or Javascript, since we have no gone over it yet. Yes part of me would like to take the initiative and try and use those, however, I feel that it takes away from the parametres of this challenge. -->

<!-- I really enjoyed this challenge. I discovered some new tags that proved to be beneficial. It helped me tremendously think about how I wanted to organize the information. Lastly, it really cemented in my brain just feeling confident coding and using all the skills ive learned in the last 30 or so episodes. Was even able to put my history degree to some use :D -->

<!-- See georgewash.html for additional notes. No other page contains notes besides these two.  -->
